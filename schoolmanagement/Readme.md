### ABOUT THE PROJECT

The project named “School Management System”, is a
student/teachers information system which is a web-based system. The
project is developed for Placement cell being presently used in schools
for storing and retrieving the information of students who are registered in
Placement Cell. The Placement Cell maintains a large database of students
wherein all the information of students including personal records and the
academic performance in terms of grades is stored and teachers information
including profile of every department, eligibility criteria and facilities it provides
etc. The software retrieves this data and displays as per the user
requirement.

The School Management System is developed as an attempt to take
a record of departments and students by restricting such a large database to that
of a particular class of students. The system provides the
facility of viewing both the personal and academic information of each student and department. Departments
can manage their activities and students information can be found easily by simply using their student Id.
An admin dashboard to give out tokens to student for signing up.

Students can also access the system with just their unique student id and password to check their results,
view their school bills and other activities or information the administrator chooses to share.

The project is to facilitate students in Senior high and college to register and
communicate with their administrators. The users access easily to this and the
data can be retrieved easily in no time. In the main page there is a form where a student can enter login details and for registration of new students as well. There is also an administrator link on the homepage where the administrators of the system can login and share and retrieve data of students quickly. In student registration form, a student would have to provide a student id, a unique code given by the administrator and password. Unique codes and student id would have to be given to every student before registration for account activation on the platform is done. Your student personal details, educational qualifications etc would be provided on every students dashboard. Students can make complains and request also from their dashboard.Every information of each student would be in a portable way for easy print out and further processes. 

The administrator can execute different queries like details of registered students, broadcast messages to all students. and can delete the records as well.

Lectures can also perform actions such as uploading student results.
